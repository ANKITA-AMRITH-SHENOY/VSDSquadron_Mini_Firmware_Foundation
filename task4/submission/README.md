# Project Name : **UART Controlled Mode Machine**

## Project Description

This project implements a UART-controlled mode machine on a CH32 microcontroller, where different LED behaviors are selected dynamically through serial commands without resetting the system. The firmware integrates multiple peripheral drivers—GPIO, UART, Timer, and PWM—to demonstrate multi-driver interaction in a single application. Users can control LED modes such as ON, OFF, blinking, breathing (PWM), pattern sequencing, and a reaction-time game via a UART terminal, making it suitable for demonstrating embedded system concepts and real hardware validation.

## Drivers Used

- **GPIO** – Controls an external LED connected to the microcontroller  
- **UART** – Receives user commands and prints status/debug messages  
- **Timer** – Provides a 1 ms system tick for delays, blinking, and timing  
- **PWM** – Controls LED brightness for breathing effect

## PWM Hardware Validation and Duty Cycle Behavior

The PWM signal was implemented using a software-based technique driven by the TIM2 update interrupt. Instead of using hardware timer output channels, PWM was generated by periodically toggling GPIOC pin PC6 inside the interrupt handler.TIM2 generates periodic interrupts. Inside the interrupt service routine, a software counter (0–99) is incremented. The counter value is compared with the desired duty cycle. If the counter is less than the duty value, the GPIO pin (PC6) is set HIGH; otherwise, it is set LOW.

## Effect of Duty Cycle on LED Brightness

The duty cycle directly controls the percentage of time the LED remains ON within one PWM period.

-At 0% duty cycle, the LED remains OFF.
-At 50% duty cycle, the LED is ON for half of each PWM period, resulting in medium brightness.
-At 100% duty cycle, the LED remains fully ON.

As the duty cycle increases, the ON-time within each PWM period increases, causing the LED brightness to increase proportionally. Conversely, decreasing the duty cycle reduces the ON-time and decreases brightness.

During testing, the duty cycle value was printed over UART while observing the LED. A visible and proportional change in brightness was observed as the duty cycle varied from low to high values. This confirms correct PWM generation and hardware-level control of the output pin.
