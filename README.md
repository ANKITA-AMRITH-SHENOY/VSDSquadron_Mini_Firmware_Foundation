## RISC-V Internship – Firmware & Hardware Exploration

This repository documents my internship work focused on RISC-V architecture, where I am learning and implementing concepts related to processor fundamentals, embedded firmware, and low-level system design.

As part of this internship, I am gaining hands-on experience with:

1. Understanding the RISC-V ISA and instruction formats
2. Writing and analyzing bare-metal firmware
3. Working with GPIO, registers, and memory-mapped I/O
4. Exploring how firmware libraries and APIs simplify hardware interaction
5. Using tools like simulators, compilers, and development boards

The goal of this repository is to track my learning journey, experiments, and tasks completed during the internship, while building a strong foundation in open-source processor architecture and embedded systems.

_This repository is intended for educational and learning purposes as part of my internship._
